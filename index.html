			<p>Hello, my name is Allison Liederman and I am a UCF grad that has recently enrolled in the UCF coding boot camp. I look forward to the challenges ahead and hope to gain a lot of knowledge and skills from the class.</p>
			<p>For the last 7 years I have been working in a retail store in Miami, FL as a website admin. During that time we have implenented a new ERP, E-Commerce, and Point of Sale System. That process was a long arduous one and my lack in knowledge of how things really work brought me to where I am today. </p>
            <p>In the long run I hope to be able to leave my current place of emplyment and look for my next big adventure. I want to wake up in the morning excited to do my job and I think coding is what will get me to that.</p>
